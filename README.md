## Introduction

This project aims to forecast Apple stock prices using time series forecasting techniques. Two models, ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), are implemented to analyze and predict stock prices.

## Features

- ARIMA model for classic time series forecasting.
- LSTM model for capturing complex temporal dependencies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) insights for understanding the dataset.
- Visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices.
- Model evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other metrics.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the dataset to understand trends, patterns, and key features. Visualize stock prices over time, check for missing values, and analyze trading volume fluctuations.

## Modeling

### ARIMA Model

Perform stationarity checks using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
Determine optimal parameters (p, d, q) based on ACF and PACF plots.
Train the ARIMA model and evaluate its performance.

### LSTM Model

Normalize and preprocess the data for LSTM.
Design and train the LSTM model.
Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Evaluation
Compare the performance of ARIMA and LSTM models. Evaluate using metrics such as MSE, MAE, or RMSE.

## Results

Visualize and interpret the results of the models. Compare the actual vs. predicted stock prices to assess the accuracy of forecasting.
